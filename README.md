# MiBot

That's an simple project for creating an Discord music bot,
you can run it locally or host somewhere else.

## Install

It's quite simple as any other small node.js projects:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/caiodomingues/MiBot.git
cd MiBot
npm install
npm start
```

Now you have it running, if it's not connecting, please check Discord docs
to make the bot join your server. You should see the bot in the server and
online.

Make sure you create an role for it too, just for safety reasons.

## Note

That's just some random study repository, it wasn't made to be the best bot in
the world etc, instead, to be simple and fast made (as it was).
